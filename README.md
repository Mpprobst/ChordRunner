# ChordRunner
Project for Global Game Jam 2023, theme: root

This is a rhythm game where you must determine the root of the chord to stay alive.

A root of a chord is one of the notes in it, but changes if the chord is inverted.
Songs were sourced from MIDI files and parsed to present the player with the notes being played.
